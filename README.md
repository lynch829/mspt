MSPT (Motion Simulator for Proton Therapy) is a research tool to study the impact of motion during the delivery of a proton therapy treatment. The simulations rely on DICOM files: the patient CT image along with a file defining structures in the patient body, the treatment plan and optionally the expected dose distribution. It simulates the spot scanning technique, used in proton therapy, with an analytical beam model. It aims at highlighting the impact of the patient motion during a treatment delivery by computing dose on the moving patient. The main interest of this simulator lies in the ability to render the impact of a predicted patient motion on a prescribed treatment plan. This capability makes it an innovative research tool to evaluate and compare different methods of motion management or mitigation.
